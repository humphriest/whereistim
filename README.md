# Ideas

May use redux hooks to handle getting the travel data and setting it in state

- I can then use the useSelector hook to fetch the data needed for that component
- This will also remove any boilerplate code needed for adding in redux
- I can use this for changing the theme too
- Add a section where they can see stats compared to where they are, kms away, time difference

# Theme

When they click a button, play an arcade coin noise, fade everything on the screen out except for the coin. The coin will pop up and go below the screen.

### Map

Big map of where I’ve been and where I am now. Me pointing to each stop
Me flying from the previous location to current

Would like to animate the lines being drawn onto the map, hitting each point and making a pinball machine sound

Shadow at bottom of map to show the user there's more below the map:
if they click it then parallax scrolling starts and brings the view below into view

### Stats

`IDEAS`

Have some stats on my trip.

- How long I've been gone (clock-ticking)
- how many cities (buildings)
- amount of shite talked (drunk person) - increasing numbers until it breaks
- amount of kms travelled (plane-flying)
- How far away I am from you (Changes per location)

Have this with icons and animating numbers

Boxes maybe

As you scroll things will animate

8-bit svgs animate in from the side

Boxes border fades in bottom to top
box content comes in from the side

As you scroll

- a pint glass icon fills up
- a plane flys up the screen

Box: solid white with a border radius of 15 maybe. If I can create a light blue outline with a blended white in the middle then do that. Almost like neon

`APPROVED`

Scroll down again and it’s a timeline of events with images coming in from the side and text showing
