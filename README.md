This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.

## Ideas

May use redux hooks to handle getting the travel data and setting it in state
- I can then use the useSelector hook to fetch the data needed for that component
- This will also remove any boilerplate code needed for adding in redux
- I can use this for changing the theme too

## Theme

Color

- Black
- Light neon blue
- neon orange
- neon red

When they click a button, play an arcade coin noise, fade everything on the screen out except for the coin. The coin will pop up and go below the screen.

### Home page

Big map of where I’ve been and where I am now. Me pointing to each stop
Me flying from the previous location to current

Shadow at bottom of map to show the user there's more below the map

Would like to animate the lines being drawn onto the map, hitting each point and making a pinball machine sound

Parallax scrolling is cool would like to include it

Have some stats on my trip. How long I've been, away how many cities, amount of time talking shite,
Have this with icons and animating numbers

Boxes maybe

As you scroll things will show and appear

Scroll down again and it’s a timeline of events with images coming in from the side and text showing
